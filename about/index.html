        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p class="muted">
          I’m a Product Support Specialist at Syntech Systems (FuelMaster), where I was promoted from Level 1 to Level 2 and work on resolving customer-impacting issues across both FuelMaster Live and Legacy. A lot of my day-to-day is technical debugging—SSH’ing into embedded Linux environments, tracing logs from OSGi services, identifying root causes, and coordinating escalations or migrations when the fix needs broader alignment. I care about outcomes as much as the details: I hit 105% of goal in my first year (2nd in the department) and maintain a 97.2% CSAT against a 95% target.

I’m also actively moving toward product development because I genuinely enjoy building software. I’ve been developing a Java/Spring Boot portfolio application using a layered architecture with Spring Data JPA and an H2 database, and I’m currently building out the Angular front end. What I like most about programming is the mix of creativity and rigor—taking messy real-world requirements and turning them into something clear, testable, and maintainable.

Outside of work, I’m an avid mountain biker, married, and a dad of two. I also spent six years as a stay-at-home parent, which sharpened my patience, prioritization, and ability to stay calm under pressure—skills that turned out to be surprisingly useful in technical support and project work. I’m into video games, comics, and reading, and I’m extremely curious by nature. I’m the kind of person who enjoys digging into the “why” behind things—whether that’s philosophy, science, or a deep technical problem—and I love conversations that go beyond the surface.

If you’re here to see what I’ve built, head over to my Projects page—each one is a snapshot of what I’m learning, what I care about, and the direction I’m heading.
